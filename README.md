# Visual Studio Code Starter Snippets âœ‚

VSC snippets that help you start projects faster. Add these files to your User Snippets to level up your productivity.

Find snippets under **File** > **Preferences** > **User Snippets** (**Code** > **Preferences** on macOS).

Or in terminal for *nix:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/victoriadrake/vsc-starter-snippets.git

# Copy to your VSC installation, usually:
cp vsc-starter-snippets/*.json /home/<username>/.config/Code/User/snippets
```

If command line installation doesn't work, you can [create a New Global Snippets file](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets#_create-your-own-snippets) in VSC and copy and paste the contents of a file from this repository.

## What's in the Box

### Starter HTML Kit

A foundational HTML page. Typing `doctype` or `!DOCTYPE` inserts the HTML Starter Kit. This has `<head>`, metadata, `<body>`, `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` elements. Tabbing helps you use multicursor to fill in the page title, description, and other customizations.

### Starter CSS Kit

A starter CSS file. Typing `startcss` or `cssme` inserts the CSS Starter Kit. This includes dark and light color schemes, responsive scaling, and companion styles for the HTML Starter Kit.

## Contributing

New snippet additions are welcome! This project is primarily for substantial snippets that save time when starting up a new project.
